# Consumer Go package

This wraps the message consumer logic into a small package.
Currently only contains a google pubsub backend but it can be extended for
other backends in the future

## Build

```
go build
```
Yes. That simple

## Test

With a pubsub emulator running, then...

```
go test
```
Once again, yes... that simple :)
